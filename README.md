# Call To Action - Volunteer Job Board 
Coding Dojo Bootcamp 2022 - Group Project (w/Neal Dreessen)

**For this group project I was designated to the conceptualization and actualization of the Front-end design in its entirety**

> Open space design with simple, but dynamic user interaction
>
> Implemented pop-up login/registration form and hidden Navigation bar using vanilla JavaScript and CSS
> 
> Design inspiration pulled from french cinema typography and paired with elements of bold minimalism
> 
> Minimalist design guides and streamlines user interaction
> 
> Neutral color scheme implemented to compliment background imagery while adding subtle, necessary pops of color without overwhelming the user
> 
>Responsive website from 1200+ px down to 300px for mobile use

<sup>Front page focusing on simplicity and only necessary information</sup>

<sup>Neutral tone dashboard accentuates volunteer job list as priority alongside a clear, concise title and navigation bar and simple button response on hover to display clear interactivity </sup>

<sup>Simple job creation page with clearly labeled form inputs. Color scheme focuses on brighter complementary color options. Matching navigation design to dashboard</sup>

<sup>Job Editor matches creator page but all input fields are auto populated with job data</sup>

<sup>Viewing page for individual jobs clearly lays out job data including the status of the jobs need for more volunteers, whether or not the user has already signed up or not, all data submitted by job poster, and a list of all other volunteers already signed up to the job. Data display differs based on status of whether or not the user viewing the page submitted this job or not.</sup>

<sup>Job details page focuses on the details of the job so the nav bar is hidden using a swiveling display page to hide and reveal the navigation options which also vary based on the status of whether or not the user logged in is the creator of the job or not </sup>
